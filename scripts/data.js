        text: "<p><i>Just the Wind</i> is a magazine all about contrasts, the duality of two separate ends, the wind and the storm. The name Just the Wind came from a Magic the Gathering™ card with the same name. The card name comes to show a moment where we ask &quot;what was it?&quot; and respond with: &quot;nothing, just the wind&quot;.<br><br>This first issue is about humanity and its next stages, how to evolve a society and how we could reach the pinnacle of the human condition. <a href='#'>The human being</a> as the center of all the universe, or the possibility that of not ever being...<br><br>With the Wind and the Storm, we want to create a blur between the real insignificance and the insignificance of the real, revealing the big picture as a drama but always keeping in mind that, like it says in the card’s flavor text, &quot;There’s nothing to worry about&quot;.</p>",
